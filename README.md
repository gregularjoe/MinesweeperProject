This is a project completed for a college class. This project was based on a
tutorial found here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfhfAxKFP-s&t=1309s.

In order to run the game, just open the index.html file in your browser of choice.
There are three difficulty settings to choose from and if you don't knwo the rules 
there is a rules button you can click to display the game rules. There is a timer 
to keep track of how long it takes to clear the board. 

There are a few odd things in this project, which are there as project requirements for the assignment.
An example is the random use of a class, kinda sticks out like a sore thumb but it was a requirement to 
use a class at least once. 
I am a beginner so it's far from perfect, but I am very happy with it. 
With that said, enjoy.
